# HardSurvivalStrategie
Minecraft Datapack with realistic crafting and behaviour.

The project is still in Alpha, so, there are things to update. Also, the project will continually getting updated when Minecraft get a official update itself.

## Requirements ##

## Installation ##

Move the Data Pack into your world's datapack folder (.minecraft/saves/WORLD/datapacks/). Be sure that the Data Pack is true root (data, pack.mcmeta) inside a .zip archive.

- Resource Pack:

## Features ##
- New crafting path! Now it's more harder to upgrade your stuff. Get ready to survive with wooden tools and grinding to reach to the top!

- New ores! Counting with Copper, Ruby, Sapphire, and Cobalt.

- Redstone? Let's get into a industrial era, using Copper Wires, Diodes, Capacitors, Electronic Circuits, and other more!

- New survival functions. The stone age never got more harder than this one.

- Coins? Well, not yet. In some future updates the ability to get coins will be implemented... so... you shouldn't use Villager Trading.

- Spell books! Now added to cast mana to get extra powers while holding it in second hand.
